# GraphicalRep-RandomData
This repo contains two files for two different functions:
1) random data generation and storing of that data into a csv file locally
2) another file which takes that csv file and uses it to make a graph

I haven't added the data.csv file only due to the fact that the file contains random data 
and it doesn't contain any speciality or uniqueness to it.
